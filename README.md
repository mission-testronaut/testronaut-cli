# 🧑‍🚀 Testronaut

**Testronaut** is an autonomous testing framework powered by **LLMs and Playwright**.  
It lets you define *mission-based tests* in plain English, then runs them through a real browser to validate UI workflows — all while generating human-readable reports.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g testronaut
```

Then initialize your project:

```bash
npx testronaut --init
```

Run the sample mission:
```bash
npx testronaut welcome.mission.js
```

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
missions/
├── login.mission.js
├── logout.mission.js
└── dashboard.mission.js
```

Each mission exports a string or function and calls `runMissions`.

---

## ✍️ Example Mission

```js
import { runMissions } from 'testronaut';

export const loginMission = `
Visit ${process.env.URL}.
Fill the username field with ${process.env.USERNAME}.
Fill the password field with ${process.env.PASSWORD}.
Click the Login button.
Wait for the dashboard to appear.
Take a screenshot.
Report SUCCESS if the dashboard is loaded, otherwise FAILURE.
`;

export async function executeMission() {
  await runMissions({ mission: loginMission }, "Login Mission");
}
```

Create a `.env` file with your credentials **and LLM API key** (depending on your chosen provider):

```bash
# For OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Or for Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...

URL=https://example.com/login
USERNAME=example@example.com
PASSWORD=********
```

---

## 🧠 LLM Provider Support

Testronaut is provider-agnostic.  
Choose your preferred LLM at init or via environment variables.

```bash
# During init
npx testronaut --init

# Or override anytime
TESTRONAUT_PROVIDER=gemini TESTRONAUT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro npx testronaut
```

Current supported providers:

| Provider | Example Models |
|-----------|----------------|
| **OpenAI** | gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, o3, gpt-5, etc. |
| **Google Gemini** | gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-8b |

More providers coming soon (Anthropic, Mistral, etc.).

---

## 🏃 Running Missions

Run all missions:
```bash
npx testronaut
```

Run a specific mission:
```bash
npx testronaut login.mission.js
```

Chain missions together:
```js
await runMissions({
  preMission: [loginMission],
  mission: fillContactFormMission,
  postMission: logoutMission,
}, "Contact Form Flow");
```
---

## 📋 Reports

Testronaut generates both JSON and HTML reports automatically under:

```
missions/mission_reports/
```

Each includes:
- Steps executed
- Token usage
- Screenshots
- Pass/Fail summaries

---

## 🧪 Under the Hood

- **Playwright** for browser automation  
- **LLMs** for reasoning, DOM parsing, and tool use  
- **Token throttling** + adaptive cooldowns  
- **Extensible architecture** for custom tools and workflows  

---

## 🧭 Mission Control

[Mission Control](https://mission.testronaut.app) lets you:
- View all reports in one dashboard  
- Track mission history and success rates  
- Compare results across environments  
- Access screenshots and step details anytime
